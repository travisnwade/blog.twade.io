Relationships are hard man...

## What I feel makes a good relationship

But, to get started, I'll list out kind of what I have found to be critical in a relationship and life partner if that's what you look to have in your life. 
Because I'll say this, having someone in your life that you share everything with, that's something that is truly fulfilling in so many ways.

> * Someone you can be honest with.
> * Share everything with and not be fearful that it'll come back to haunt you later.
> * Someone you can be whatever you need to be in that moment with, and that person will never judge, belittle or use it against you.
> * Someone whome you can share in responsibilities, gorw together, be humble together, learn from each other...

This, right here, is something that is truly a treasure when you find it. And I'll give you a little secret to help you find this. The first 
thing isn't always finding that someone that you can be these things with, but more rather you NEED to be able to look in the mirror and say to 
the person in the reflection these things:

> * I understand I'm not perfect. And that's OK. I'm learning and trying.
> * I do love myself, and all of my imperfections. I am only human.
{: .prompt-tip}

There is a liberation I find in your own humbleness. Before you can be honest with anyone else, you first need to be able to be honest with yourself. Once you find this part, you can then begin to open yourself up of an opportunity that can be truly lifechanging.

## Finding yourself is number one

One of the best things that I did before I found my current partner, is that I took a good year to myself. To be myself, to live with myself, to find myself.  There is no prescription for this either. To some, being alone may sound scary. It may even cause an anxiety that seems impossible to navigate through. But trust me, at least for me, it was one of the best things I ever did.  There is a healing nature to being by yourself for a bit, to re-discover yourself or discover yourself from the beginning if you've never done so. I know that this may sound a bit strange in the beginning, but trust me.  Our own conciousness can be deep and tangled. 

Finding those little sidestreets in yourself can be amazing. 

* What makes you react the way you react?
* What about your life gives you the perception you carry about your surroundings and in others?
* What makes you happy? Not the material, but your _soul_.
* What is it that you want in life?

I say this pretty frequently too, and I feel it's true:

> How can you fully love someone else if you don't first love yourself?

So, whatever it is, do what you gotta do to be happy with you.  First and foremost.  If you're already in a relationship, you need to communicate with your partner this need. If they're supportive, then they'll understand, and support you in your journey.

## The search for that person

This search for that person isn't something you can rush either. And you need to be able to move past what doesn't fit, or what doesn't feel right in your _gut_. You need to trust your intuition. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. And you really need to believe that. You also need to not feel discouraged when someone of this caliper doesn't land in 6 weeks.  It _will_ take longer 99% of the time. Take your time, and it'll come.

### Not all relationships are free from discomfort

You also need to understand that the perfect relationship isn't one that's free of disagreement, fights and discomfort. ALL relationships have those aspects. After all, we're human and we're going to disagree. We're going to hurt each other at some point. There are so many factors that go into this and it's not always intentional. 

What's important is the recovery. How do you has a couple recover? The yelling and name calling never gets anyone anywhere. As a couple, you need to learn how to communicate respectfully. Not just the _how_ to communicate, but the _when_.  There are moments we're just not quite ready to communicate. Sometimes, we just need a bit of time to gather ourselves, break down if we need to, be alone if we need to.  And your partner needs to understand that.

My partner and I do understand this.  It took a bit of learning on both of our parts, but we didn't give up on each other and we listened to each other. Something like:

> Babe, I think I just need a little bit of time before I'm ready to chat.

That doesn't mean I don't want to talk, it just means I'm not ready quite yet.  And that's OK.  Sometimes we need to simply collect ourselves, our emotions before we're ready to communicate _effectively_ and _respectfully_. We've all lashed out in emotion, and that rarely goes well. There's a time and place for that I feel, but when it comes to the person that you love, we all need to try out best to remember how much they mean to us when we communicate.

### Be real and honest with people

When you're out in the world meeting people and dating, be real. Be yourself.  Even if you think you're weird or different.  There's someone out there for everyone. I know that sounds a bit cliche, but it's true. When people call me weird, I just respond with, "Yep, I sure am and that's alright. I love it.". Seriously, _be yourself_.

Putting on a front to impress someone, that usually (in my experience) only comes back in a bad way.  They build this perception of you that you put on when you were being someone you aren't. It can be a waste of time for everyone involved. Your time and their time. If you aren't a good fit for them, or the other way around. It almost always ends in someone's feelings getting hurt or worse, heartbreak. Do yourself and others a favor, don't waste their or your time being someone you're not. Be you.

## In the end

In the end, finding the right person for you, revolves around you being honest with yourself, loving yourself. The right person will land naturally, at some point. Don't be in a rush. Trust me, I've been the person to rush into relationships, and it never ended well. There were lessons learned however, many of them. We all make mistakes and especially if you're a person with a big and good heart, you'll find excuses to tell yourself to remain in a relationship that's not for you.  I've done it. I recognize that. 

However, the relationship I'm in now, well I'll just say it's the best one I've ever had. And again, not because it's without our disagreements. There are plenty.  But over time, we've learned about each other and each person's specific needs. Whether we need a bit of time, our approach and how we come to a common understanding.  These are things that take time, and not something that can be rushed.

You hear it all the time, relationships take work. And lots of it. And a steady stream of it.  But the best relationships are worth it, and you'll _want_ to put in that work.
