Relationships are hard man...

## What I feel makes a good relationship

But, to get started, I'll list out kind of what I have found to be critical in a relationship and life partner if that's what you look to have in your life. 
Because I'll say this, having someone in your life that you share everything with, that's something that is truly fulfilling in so many ways.

> * Someone you can be honest with.
> * Share everything with and not be fearful that it'll come back to haunt you later.
> * Someone you can be whatever you need to be in that moment with, and that person will never judge, belittle or use it against you.
> * Someone whome you can share in responsibilities, gorw together, be humble together, learn from each other...

This, right here, is something that is truly a treasure when you find it. And I'll give you a little secret to help you find this. The first 
thing isn't always finding that someone that you can be these things with, but more rather you NEED to be able to look in the mirror and say to 
the person in the reflection these things:

> * I understand I'm not perfect. And that's OK. I'm learning and trying.
> * I do love myself, and all of my imperfections. I am only human.

There is a liberation I find in your own humbleness. Before you can be honest with anyone else, you first need to be able to be honest with yourself. Once you find this part, you can then begin to open yourself up of an opportunity that can be truly lifechanging.

## Finding yourself is number one

One of the best things that I did before I found my current partner, is that I took a good year to myself. To be myself, to live with myself, to find myself.  There is no prescription for this either. To some, being alone may sound scary. It may even cause an anxiety that seems impossible to navigate through. But trust me, at least for me, it was one of the best things I ever did.  There is a healing nature to being by yourself for a bit, to re-discover yourself or discover yourself from the beginning if you've never done so. I know that this may sound a bit strange in the beginning, but trust me.  Our own conciousness can be deep and tangled. 

Finding those little sidestreets in yourself can be amazing. 

* What makes you react the way you react?
* What about your life gives you the perception you carry about your surroundings and in others?
* What makes you happy? Not the material, but your _soul_.
* What is it that you want in life?

## The search for that person

This search for that person isn't something you can rush either. And you need to be able to move past what doesn't fit, or what doesn't feel right in your _gut_. You need to trust your intuition. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. And you really need to believe that. 

You also need to understand that the perfect relationship isn't one that's free of disagreement, fights and discomfort. ALL relationships have those aspects. After all, we're human and we're going to disagree. We're going to hurt each other at some point. There are so many factors that go into this and it's not always intentional. 

What's important is the recovery. How do you has a couple recover? The yelling and name calling never gets anyone anywhere. As a couple, you need to learn how to communicate respectfully. Not just the _how_ to communicate, but the _when_.  There are moments we're just not quite ready to communicate. Sometimes, we just need a bit of time to gather ourselves, break down if we need to, be alone if we need to.  And your partner needs to understand that.

My partner and I do understand this.  It took a bit of learning on both of our parts, but we didn't give up on each other and we listened to each other. Something like:

> Babe, I think I just need a little bit of time before I'm ready to chat.

That doesn't mean I don't want to talk, it just means I'm not ready quite yet.  And that's OK.  Sometimes we need to simply collect ourselves, our emotions before we're ready to communicate _effectively_ and _respectfully_. We've all lashed out in emotion, and that rarely goes well. There's a time and place for that I feel, but when it comes to the person that you love, we all need to try out best to remember how much they mean to us when we communicate.
