## Preamble

Just a bit of a preamble here, my workout routines are mostly very unstructured.  At least these days they are.  I try to still maintain a bit of mixture through the week and what I workout so that I'm not overworking specific muscle groups. So in that regard, it's _kind of_ structured, but also kind of not. 

My thing is, I go to the gym for a couple of reasons.  But the biggest reason I go to the gym, is for me. The other two reasons are:

* My mental health. I'm there for me and that's my time to be in my thoughts, my mode, my own energy.
* My physical health. Keeping my muscles fresh and strong.

So that said, I'll list these workout plans in the best way that I can, but it's up to you to figure out the days, any workout modifications you want to add and all of that jazz.

### Keep this in mind for your exercises

Exercising is more than just the physical aspect. If you really want to get the most out of your workout, you've gotta really hone in on your _focus_ to the muscle groups you're working out. Here are a few things to think about when you're exercising:

* Too much weight is bad. Form is everything.  Drop the weight a bit so you can maintain a good form.  The strength will come naturally as long as you're maintaining an excellent form. Too much weight can also lead to injury.  Take care of yourself.
* When you're lifting weight, mentally focus on the muscles you're using during that exercise, and see if you can possibly flex those muscles during your workout.  Not too hard of course, but you'll get into a habit and understanding of your muscles the more you do this. And the more focus you have on the muscle groups you're working out, the more targeted you can be with your goals (and the exercises you chose to do).
* Breath. I breath out when I'm using my muscles to lift the weights. And I breath in on the down. It helps, trust me.
* Water. Drink enough that you're not running on empty, but don't chug your water.

Again, mental focus while you're exercising is huge. Mental focus, as well as form. Those are more important than the actual amount of weight or reps that you're doing.

## Chest Workouts
