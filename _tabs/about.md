[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8eeb4d82-4c84-49f0-a86b-6d2d1b3493be/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sage-lebkuchen-65afd8/deploys)

This started off as a little side project I wanted to do.  I already had [another site](https://docs.twade.io) where I document
frequent tasks I do that I can use as a reference point to look to, but also to serve as a place where
others can go for information related to technical obstacles as well. 

This site however, is for more general thoughts that I wanted to share. Thoughts and perceptions on life, the human
condition, what makes us who we are and all sorts of things.

## A little about me

I'm a person who's been through all sorts of things in life. From tragedy to blessings and everything in between.  I often
get lost in big picture items and the universe. Getting lost in those thoughts and applying my own lessons that I've
learned through life to derive my perceptions on things.  

I'm someone who tries to remain humble, aware of the fact that I have so much more to learn. I hope that you find this content
interesting in the least, and you'll get an inside view into my messed up head :). 

## Quick closing

Any how, I hope you enjoy.  Again, this is somethign I started as a little side project and wanted to expand my skillsets
in various technologies. But can also serve as a place that I'll dump my crazy views on just about anything and everything.
